        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cranberry sauce is a must-have for holiday dinners, and this fresh, homemade version is one I make every year. It's naturally sweet, bright, zingy, and delightfully chunky — the ideal texture to spoon over anything and everything on your plate!
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <li>4 cups (about a 12-ounce package) fresh or frozen cranberries</li>
            <li>½ cup honey or maple syrup, or more as desired</li>
            <li>½ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>orange zest, optional</li>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the orange juice mixture. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the water, orange juice, and honey and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the cranberries and give everything stir.</li>
            <li>Simmer the sauce. Bring the mixture back to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let it simmer for 5 to 10 minutes while stirring occasionally. The cranberries will burst (that's what you want) and the sauce will start to thicken.</li>
            <li>Let it cool. Turn the heat off and let it cool for 15 minutes. Then transfer it to a container and place it in the fridge to chill and thicken up.</li>
        </ol>
