            <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.</li>
